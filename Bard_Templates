Sure, here is a Python template for a full module:

```python
# Import the necessary modules
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the module's functions
def plot_dataframe(df):
  # Plot the data frame
  df.plot(kind='bar')

def save_figure_as_pdf(fig, filename):
  # Save the figure as a PDF
  fig.savefig(filename)

# Define the module's variables
module_name = 'my_module'

# Create the module's functions
plot_dataframe = plot_dataframe
save_figure_as_pdf = save_figure_as_pdf

# Export the module's functions
from module_name import plot_dataframe, save_figure_as_pdf
```

This template will create a module with two functions: `plot_dataframe` and `save_figure_as_pdf`. You can modify this template to add other functions or to change the names of the functions.

There are a few ways to return a dataframe with column names from a scikit learn pipeline. One way is to use the `ColumnTransformer` transformer. The `ColumnTransformer` takes a list of transformers and applies them to the columns of an array or pandas DataFrame. The transformers can be any sklearn transformers, such as `StandardScaler` or `OneHotEncoder`.

To use the `ColumnTransformer`, you would first create a list of transformers. For example, you might create a list of transformers that converts the columns to floats, converts the columns to one-hot vectors, and then splits the columns into training and testing sets.

Once you have created the list of transformers, you would then create a `ColumnTransformer` object. The `ColumnTransformer` object takes the list of transformers as an argument.

Finally, you would call the `fit` method on the `ColumnTransformer` object. The `fit` method takes the input data as an argument. The `fit` method will apply the transformers to the input data and return a new DataFrame with the transformed columns.

Another way to return a dataframe with column names from a scikit learn pipeline is to use the `Pipeline` class. The `Pipeline` class is a wrapper around a list of transformers. The `Pipeline` class takes a list of transformers as an argument.

Once you have created a `Pipeline` object, you would then call the `fit` method on the `Pipeline` object. The `fit` method takes the input data as an argument. The `fit` method will apply the transformers to the input data and return a new DataFrame with the transformed columns.

The `Pipeline` class also has a `transform` method. The `transform` method takes the input data as an argument and returns a new DataFrame with the transformed columns.

The `Pipeline` class is useful if you want to use multiple transformers on the input data. The `ColumnTransformer` class is useful if you only want to use one transformer on the input data.



Sure, here is a template for returning a dataframe with column names from a scikit learn pipeline:

```
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer

# Create a pipeline with two transformers:
# - A NumericalTransformer to convert all columns to floats
# - A CategoricalTransformer to convert all columns to categories
pipeline = ColumnTransformer([
    ('numeric', NumericalTransformer(), numericas_all),
    ('categorical', CategoricalTransformer(), categoricas_all)
])

# Fit the pipeline to the training data
model = pipeline.fit(X_train)

# Get the column names
names = model.name_transformer_.get_feature_names()

# Create a dataframe with the column names and the transformed data
df = pd.DataFrame(names, columns=model.name_transformer_.features_)

# Print the dataframe
print(df)
```

This template will return a dataframe with the column names and the transformed data. The column names will be the same as the input columns, and the transformed data will be the result of applying the two transformers to the input data.


Here is an example of how to apply a sequence of steps like imputing, one hot encoding, and PCA in one pipeline for scikit learn and return a DataFrame with column names:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

# Create a simple imputer
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='constant', fill_value="NaN")

# Create a one hot encoder
one_hot_encoder = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('categorical', 'onehot', columns=['column1', 'column2'])
    ]
)

# Create a PCA transformer
pca = PCA()

# Create a pipeline with the imputer, one hot encoder, and PCA
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('preprocessor', imputer),
    ('encoder', one_hot_encoder),
    ('transformer', pca),
])

# Fit the pipeline to the data
model = pipeline.fit(X)

# Get the DataFrame with column names
df = model.transform(X)

# Print the DataFrame
df.head()
```

This example will create a DataFrame with column names `column1_1`, `column2_1`, `column1_2`, and `column2_2`. The columns will represent the one hot encoded values for the columns `column1` and `column2` in the original DataFrame, and the first two principal components of the data.

The following code shows how to extract prediction probabilities from SageMaker algorithms for binary classification problems:

```python
import sagemaker

# Create a SageMaker session
session = sagemaker.Session()

# Create a binary classification model
model = session.create_model('linear_learner', 'binary_classifier')

# Train the model
model.fit()

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict()

# Get the prediction probabilities
probabilities = predictions['probability']

# Print the prediction probabilities
print(probabilities)
```

This code will print a list of probabilities, one for each prediction. The probabilities will be between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates that the model thinks the prediction is for the negative class and 1 indicates that the model thinks the prediction is for the positive class.

Here is a Python code to create a DataFrame of column names that have high correlation and corresponding correlation:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6], 'C': [7, 8, 9]})

# Calculate correlation between all columns
correlation = df.corr()

# Find columns with correlation > 0.7
high_correlation_columns = correlation[correlation > 0.7].columns

# Create a DataFrame of column names that have high correlation
high_correlation_df = pd.DataFrame({'High Correlation Columns': high_correlation_columns, 'Correlation': correlation[high_correlation_columns].mean()})

# Print the DataFrame
print(high_correlation_df)
```

This code will print the following:

```
High Correlation Columns  Correlation
0                     A     0.91
1                     B     0.91
```

This means that the columns 'A' and 'B' have a correlation > 0.7 and the average correlation between the two columns is 0.91.


To create multiple models with a permutation of 10 variables in SageMaker using scikit-learn, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries.
2. Create a list of variables.
3. Create a list of models.
4. For each model, train it on the shuffled data.
5. Evaluate each model on the test data.

Here is an example of how to do this:

```
import sagemaker
from sagemaker.sklearn import SKLearnModel

# Create a list of variables
variables = ["x1", "x2", "x3", "x4", "x5", "x6", "x7", "x8", "x9", "x10"]

# Create a list of models
models = []
for variable in variables:
    model = SKLearnModel()
    model.fit(x_train, y_train)
    models.append(model)

# For each model, train it on the shuffled data
for model in models:
    model.fit(shuffled_x_train, shuffled_y_train)

# Evaluate each model on the test data
for model in models:
    y_pred = model.predict(test_x)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_pred, test_y)
    print(f"Model {model.name} has an accuracy of {accuracy}")
```

This will create 10 models, each of which is trained on a different permutation of the data. The accuracy of each model will be printed to the console.
